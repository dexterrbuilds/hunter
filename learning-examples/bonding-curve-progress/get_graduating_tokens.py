"""Watch for pump.fun coins approaching graduation, over plain WebSocket RPC.

Usage:
    uv run learning-examples/bonding-curve-progress/get_graduating_tokens.py
    uv run learning-examples/bonding-curve-progress/get_graduating_tokens.py --min-progress 95

Why a subscription and not `getProgramAccounts`: the pump.fun program now owns
over 10 million accounts, and every provider refuses to scan it. Helius, Alchemy
and dRPC reject with `Too many accounts requested (10000001 pubkeys)`; other
providers time out. No filter set fixes that — the rejection is on program size,
before filters apply. `getProgramAccountsV2` is a provider extension (Helius,
Solana Tracker), not core Agave, and its `limit` is a *scan* budget rather than a
result count, so answering this question with it means ~1000 sequential pages.

`programSubscribe` sidesteps the scan entirely. A curve can only approach
graduation by being traded, and every write to it pushes the full 151-byte account,
so each notification carries everything needed to compute progress — there is no
state to accumulate and no cold start beyond the next trade. Verified accepted on
both a paid endpoint and the public `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.

See `get_graduating_tokens_geyser.py` for the same report over Geyser gRPC, which
also gives you the transaction signature behind each update.

Selecting a graduation threshold
--------------------------------
Progress is measured against `Global.initial_real_token_reserves` (~793.1M tokens)
read from chain, not a hardcoded constant, because a mayhem coin can launch with
different virtual params and would otherwise show the wrong percentage.

The pre-filter the server applies can only match exact bytes, so it cannot do
"anything above 90%". It can only do a few fixed cutoffs. `--min-progress` uses the
closest cutoff that is still wide enough, then makes the exact comparison here:

    filter               cutoff                 ≈ graduated past
    2 zero bytes @ 30    281.5M tokens left     64.5%
    3 zero bytes @ 29    1.1M tokens left       99.86%
    4 zero bytes @ 28    4,295 tokens left      99.9995%

    --min-progress       pre-filtered by the server?
    below 64.5%          no, every curve arrives and is filtered here
    64.5% to 99.86%      yes, at the 64.5% cutoff
    99.86% and up        yes, at the 99.86% cutoff

So the pre-filter saves traffic, it does not decide the answer — whatever percentage
you ask for is honoured either way. Low thresholds just cost more bandwidth. If you
want to hand-tune, pick a different cutoff from the table: the last moments before
migration want the 3-byte one, a wider funnel the 2-byte one.

Checked against mainnet by running the filtered and unfiltered subscriptions side by
side for a minute: same curves, nothing dropped, nothing extra.

`dataSize: 151` restricts this to the current curve layout. The original 49-byte
layout (no `creator` field) still has accounts with `complete = false`, but none of
them are written to any more — verified over a 45s window in which all 205 updates
across 24 curves were 151-byte accounts.
